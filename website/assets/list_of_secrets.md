# Secrets

Slow Start Secret: For real estate agents there is a delay between work and payment. New agents will typically see their first commission check arrive 3-6 months after starting. Because of this time lag new agents should keep their expenses lean until closing a few deals.

The Database Ditch Secret: Export your entire database at least once a year. Accidents happen, and a backup is a good safety step. Also, someday you may change brokerages and will undoubtedly want to take your database with you. Keeping a backup of your database gives you peace of mind.

Borrowed Buyer Secret: Ask a more experienced agent in your office if they have any buyer clients they could send your way. You would pay the other agent a referral fee, so both of you make money when the deal closes. That way, the more experienced agent can focus on more profitable clients, like listings.

Friend & Family First Secret: To jump-start your first sales, offer a friends and family commission discount to your relatives and close friends. You can also extend this insider treatment as a special deal to your first client in a new geographic farm. This approach generates immediate goodwill and makes new clients feel like they are being treated just like family.

Back Scratcher Secret: Look for opportunities where your success directly benefits your mentor. This can be assisting them with open houses, following up with leads they can’t get to, or taking overflow clients. When your growth adds to their production, you create a partnership where both of you are invested in each other’s success.

Elevator Answer Secret: Always be able to answer the question: “How is the market?” When you answer, it should be with an in-depth explanation that includes local inventory levels, average days on the market, and recent sales. Taking a step beyond “yes,” “no,” or “it’s complicated” is important in selling yourself by showing that you are an authority on the market.

The Lead Source Secret: Whenever you add someone into your CRM, always label how they found you. This practice helps you identify which lead sources generate the most volume of leads. However, the number of leads is not as important as their profitability. At the end of each quarter, analyze your lead sources to see which ones generated closings. That way, you can focus on the most profitable lead sources.

Fit the Family Secret: When you show your buyer a listing, take the time to understand what they are looking for, not only in features, but from the community. Take time to ask about resources such as churches, schools, hospitals, shops, and even consider ages of the children and their needs. By taking a wholistic approach to the home purchase process, you are connecting your buyer with the neighborhood in ways that build enthusiasm for not just the home, but the community.

The Scan the Scribble Secret: Emails often feel automated and cold. To stand out you can add a handwritten signature. This small detail makes your communication feel more personal and professional. Sign your name on white paper and take a picture. Upload that picture to your CRM’s signature editor, and now you can include it to all your email and print communications.

Lead with the Letterhead Secret: Many CRM’s offer a letterhead feature which allows you place your company logo and portrait photo at the top of your correspondence. That way, this information is immediately visible when someone starts reading your email. Putting your branding at the bottom in your signature is not ideal. Most people decide if they want to delete or read an email within just a second or two and won’t bother scrolling down to see your email signature. So, to maximize the chances someone will read your email, make sure your branding is at the top of all your emails by using the letterhead feature of your CRM.

Noted Calling Card Secret: Leave the back of your business card blank so you can jot a personal note during conversations. This transforms a generic card into a memorable, customized reminder of your interaction. (Make sure your selected card stock will take pen and pencil, so no shiny backs).

The Blog the Block Secret: Write blog posts highlighting local businesses and attractions instead of only focusing on real estate. This positions you as a community ambassador who is willing to build relationships with business owners and locals.

Fire & Brimstone Briar Secret: Avoid posting on social media about divisive topics which can harm your personal brand, such as politics or religion.

Forever Home Flyer Secret: Partner with your local animal shelter to feature a “Pet of the Week” on the back of your property flyers. Include a photo of an adoptable animal and a short bio from the shelter. This simple act changes your marketing material into a community service piece. Instead of just another agent with just another listing, you become a friend of dogs everywhere.

Trust But Verify Secret: CRM vendors sometimes advertise features that sound amazing. But sometimes things sound better than they are. The only way to trust a CRM feature is to use the free trial and personally test that feature. If you get stuck, call technical support. That’s when you’ll find out if those features were too good to be true and how good the technical support really is. The last thing you want to do is purchase a CRM and then later realize that the product is buggy, works imperfectly, or the salesperson exaggerated its capabilities.

The Text to Top Secret: Consider adding new notes to the top of the notes field, rather than the end. That way, you don’t have to scroll to the end of the notes to see the latest note. Your CRM may have a preference setting which makes this automatic.

The Divorce Divide Secret: Use one contact record per family to keep communications unified but split them into two records during a divorce to manage the relationship professionally. 

The Speed-to-Lead Secret: Respond to all internet needs as quickly as possible, preferably within 5 minutes. Each lead you get is probably also reaching out to other agents as well. Take advantage of the features in your CRM to minimize your response times such as email feed, call capture, click-to-dial, and smart phone synchronization. 

The Monthly Mastery Secret: Focus on learning one CRM skill each month to avoid being overwhelmed by the features. For example, you might try experimenting with eCards the first month, printing labels the next month, real estate calculators the third month, commission tracking after that, and so on.                                                        

The Friends First Secret: Do not promote your real estate business to your friends, family or past clients. Instead, should focus on building authentic relationships by taking interest in their lives. This means celebrating milestones, chatting about sports, or talking about the local news.                                                                 

The Zap Trap Secret: A good real estate CRM will come included with email feed. Beware of vendors pretending to offer similar functionality using Zapier. Zapier costs extra and requires extensive work to configure for each lead source. Email feed comes pre-configured to parse hundreds of common lead sources (Zillow, IDX website, Trulia, Realtor.com) and does not cost extra. 

Freedom has a Price Secret: Beware of the ‚Äúfree‚Äù CRMs which your broker or MLS provides. These products often follow a ‚Äúfreemium‚Äù model, where the free version offers basic functionality with an expectation that users will eventually pay to upgrade. Since you did not select this product of your own free will, it may not be competitive. Many such systems are rarely updated and offer minimal technical support. 

Morning Map, Evening Wrap Secret: Sign into your CRM each morning before you start work and each evening before you go to bed. Check your calendar for your hard commitments, as well as your tasks list which are activities which you can handle between appointments. This is your way of holding yourself accountable for making the most of every day. Without a plan, it is too easy to get distracted and less productive.

The Time Machine Tune-Up Secret: Log your work in 15-minute intervals for a full week to see how you are spending your time. This is an easy way to reveal inefficiencies which you might be able to eliminate.

Gratitude Gift Secret: Track referrals in your CRM and send your top referral sources a holiday gift each year. Proactive gratitude keeps you top-of-mind.

Flyer in a Flash Secret: You do not need to be a graphic designer to create professional materials. Use your CRM’s built-in flyer templates to save time and money. A good system includes dozens of designs for common situations. Plug in your photos, property details, and your brand elements. The system generates a polished, print-ready PDF in seconds. This keeps your brand consistent across all listings without opening a design program.

Task vs Appointment Secret: Keep your task list separated from your calendar, tasks go in your task list and appointments go in your calendar.

Task: A to-do item without a fixed time, for example: install yard sign, follow up with Jane.

Appointment: A hard commitment at a specific time and place, for example: a closing or a showing.

The Tasks Together Secret: Add the same category to tasks that done together, so you can batch errands and site visits efficiently, cutting wasted travel time.

One-and-Done Task Secret: Whenever possible, handle each task only once. Avoid re-reading the same emails, notes, or to-dos multiple times without action.

The Click, Call, Close Secret: Each day you should schedule time in your calendar to making follow-up calls. To speed up this process build a daily call list and use the click-to-dial feature in your CRM to quickly call one person after the other. Add notes as you talk and schedule a follow-up call before you hang up.

Budget Before Browse Secret: For buyers who have not yet met a loan officer, use your CRM’s maximum loan calculator in your very first meeting with a new buyer to set a realistic price range before showing homes. This prevents wasted time on unaffordable properties and establishes you as a knowledgeable, financially savvy advisor from the start.

Know your Net Secret: Use your CRM to calculate net commission after splits, franchise fees, and referral fees. You can use these figures alongside your expenses to work out cash flow and take-home pay.

The Tax Tag Tally Secret: When entering business expenses into your CRM make sure to assign each expense one specific tax category. By using the categories that match the categories the IRS uses, you save yourself time when you do your taxes. You can then easily export sub-totals for each category, which can be used to fill out your taxes.

Trip Trimmer Secret: By storing your files in the cloud, you reduce your need to drive somewhere to access important documents. This saves you on trips to pick up and drop off paperwork.

The Perpetual Prospect Loop Secret: The moment you finish a call or meeting with a prospect, schedule the next follow-up task in your CRM before you hang up or walk away. This ensures every interaction ends with a clear next step and keeps your pipeline moving.

The Triple Tag Secret: Assign at least three categories to each person in your CRM. You should categorize each prospect as a “Buyer” or “Seller”. When categorizing contacts, do that based on your relationship with them, such as “Friend”, “Family”, or “Church”. Then assign a special status to each person, such as “Hot”, “Cold”, or “Top100”. You can even use a “Christmas” category to keep track of who gets an annual card. For vendors, list the kind of vendor they are, like “Electrician”, “Plumber”, and add a second generic “Vendor” category.

Dashboard to Dollars Secret: Your CRM can track both your deal pipeline as well as your past income. This is perfect for tracking progress towards a specific financial goal like making 20% more this year compared with last year.

Prospecting Power Hour Secret: Schedule time in your calendar each day for outbound prospecting. By reserving this time, you can maintain a steady flow of new prospects. Think of this as your ‚Äúme‚Äù time. At other times you are helping people buy and sell, but during office hours you are dedicated to generating new leads. 

Ping, Don‚Äôt Pester Secret: Time released emails tend to work best when used in moderation and when spaced out at least a week apart. If you send too many emails, people will just opt out. You are less likely to convert someone who finds you irritating. 

Notable Nametag Secret: You should consider wearing a nametag during open houses and floor time. This will help people remember your name and feel less awkward speaking with you. Your nametag clearly identifies you as the host, making it easier to solicit feedback and gather contact information. When you are face-to-face with someone wearing a nametag, they are more likely to address you by name verbally, reinforcing the connection in their memory. 

Barefoot Buyer Secret: Place a sign by the door asking people to remove their shoes or to put on the disposable booties you provide. This keeps the home clean, shows respect for the owner, and gives buyers the impression that the property is of high quality and has been well cared for. 

The Seller Security Secret: Insist on collecting contact information for every visitor at an open house. Greet every visitor with a firm but friendly script: “Welcome! For security purposes, the seller requires every guest to sign in before touring the home.” That way you can capture contact information for follow-up.                                     

Flyer Feedback Secret: Use the questions people ask at your open house to refine and improve your flyer and MLS descriptions. Sometimes specific features, like stainless steel appliances, or quartz countertop become trendy. If you can highlight desirable features, that can maximize its appeal.

Broker Bowl Secret: Place a fishbowl at your broker open with a request that agents drop their business card in the bowl with the price they think the home will sell for written on the back of the card. The person who comes closest wins a gift card to the restaurant of their choice and bragging rights as the most accurate agent. For the price of a gift card, you have just gotten a professional Broker Price Opinion (BPO) from the people most qualified to provide it. By making it a competition, you are less likely to get lowball estimates. You can load the contact information from these business cards into your real estate CRM by using a smart phone app which converts photos of business cards into contact records.

The Lock or Lease Secret: Don’t assume every buyer you meet should be a homeowner. Use the rent-vs-Own calculator in your real estate CRM to determine if renting makes sense over home ownership.

The Campfire Comp Secret: Show your mastery of the market by sharing the backstory of each comparable. How long it was listed, what upgrades or issues affected the sale, and why it sold for its final price. Knowing the history of both the property and the local market turns raw data into persuasive expertise.

The Builder Backstory Secret: Research the original builders of the homes in your geographic farm. Try to get old original floorplans and promotional materials from those original builders. Really get to know the houses, what the shortcomings are, what the most common changes and upgrades are and so forth. Understanding these aspects will give you expertise that no other agent can match, especially when you are preparing CMAs and doing listing presentations.

Backroom Briefing Secret: Attend local city planning and zoning meetings to gain knowledge about what will affect future property values. These meetings will not only allow you to connect with people in the local area but also gives you advanced notice about local changes. This knowledge will make you an indispensable authority able to advise clients on the long-term outlook of the local area.

Neighborhood Newcomer Secret: Monitor property sales in your farm area and personally welcome new homeowners with a small gift and local resource guide. Most agents ignore their buyer clients as soon as they cash their commission check. By being the first friendly face in the neighborhood, you create an immediate relationship.

Listen & Learn Secret: When door knocking you should skip the sales pitch. Introduce yourself and ask, “What is it about this neighborhood that helped you decide to move here?” Listening to their answers builds rapport, disarms homeowners, and gives you authentic language and insights to use in future marketing.

Deeds to Leads Secret: Promoting good causes for which you volunteer for can be beneficial to your brand, especially when people see you actively participating. It can also be a great way to meet people in a socially friendly way.

The Haunted House Secret: When contacting absentee owners, research the property’s history and status. By knowing if it’s a rental, vacant, or has been on the market before you contact them allows you to provide customized advice which matches their unique situation.

Give Gratitude Secret: After meeting a potential client, follow up the same day with a personal note referencing your conversation. Acting fast will keep you at the top of their mind.

Stagger, Don’t Stack Secret: When you send a series of letters or postcards in the postal mail, send each letter at least 1 week apart. Otherwise, you run the risk of one piece arriving alongside the other. USPS does not deliver on Sundays or federal holidays, and delivery times can vary for reasons outside your control.

Bag of Money Secret: When the phone rings, answer it. Just imagine that the person on the other end of the phone is a cash buyer who wants to buy a home today.

The Ping After Ring Secret: If your call goes to voicemail, immediately follow it up with a short, personalized text message. Text messages have a high open rate, guaranteeing they will see it. Mention that you just called, why you called, and invite them to reply by text or calling back.

Millennial Minute Secret: Don’t forget to take advantage of the text message chat functionality of your CRM. Many people screen their calls, or can’t answer because they are at work. Around 75% of millennials prefer texting over calling, with that figure rising to 80% among Gen Z. Around 25% of this age group avoid answering the phone altogether.

The Timely Touch Secret: At your first contact with the client ask them how they prefer to be reached: phone, email, or text and at what times. Logging this in your CRM shows respect for their schedule and increases the likelihood your outreach is welcomed.

The Sweet Role Secret: Avoid sending bulk emails to role-based email addresses. A role-based email address is one associated with a job function, department, or group within an organization, rather than an individual. They typically start with a common word that describes the purpose or role, such as info@, support@, sales@. Replace these emails with a named person when you can. If you cannot, keep the address for transactional replies only. Spam filters and mail providers look dimly in sending bulk emails to role-based email addresses.

Plain Text Paradox Secret: For higher open and reply rates, send simple, plain-text emails instead of flashy HTML ones. These personal-feeling emails are less likely to be flagged as spam and can increase reply rates by over 20% and clicks by up to 51%, a finding supported by extensive marketing research. Save branding for your signature.

The Caps for Clarity Secret: Format your email address in CamelCase, capitalizing the first letter of each word (e.g., SamSmith@gmail.com) to make it easier to read and remember. While it doesn’t affect delivery, it improves perception, reduces typos, and increases the likelihood prospects will contact you successfully.

Template Treasury Secret: Use your CRMs content library to save hours of work. Your CRM comes with a pre-built library containing templates for eCards, flyers, letters, and email campaigns for every situation. Always look to the library before writing or designing something from scratch, it will save you time and look more professional.

The Ugly Envelope Effect Secret: To make your letters look more personal and less like junk mail, handwrite the address and return mailing address. To add to the personal look, you can use a commemorative or seasonal stamp. This adds a special touch that makes people less likely to simply throw it away.

Borino Boomerang Secret: When prospecting using printed letters, send a short introductory letter. A week later, send the exact same letter, but this time crumpled up with a handwritten note on it like, “Don’t throw this away! Let’s get your home sold.” The homeowner will think you rescued it from their trash, a bold move that grabs their attention and makes you unforgettable.

Priceless Paper Secret: When you make flyers for your listing, remove the house price. Hiding the price gives you two benefits: One, if the house’s price gets reduced you won’t need to replace the flyers. Two, it forces price-curious buyers to call your call capture number which turns an inquiry into a captured lead.

Bungled Birthday Secret: Sending an automated birthday e-card misses out on a more personal touch. Use your CRM’s birthday reminders to make a phone call instead, which is more effective. This is especially true for a “Top100” contact.

Millennial Minute Secret: Don’t forget to take advantage of the text message chat functionality of your CRM. Many people screen their calls, or can’t answer because they are at work. Around 75% of millennials prefer texting over calling, with that figure rising to 80% among Gen Z. Around 25% of this age group avoid answering the phone altogether.

The Accidental Assistant Secret: As your team expands, the chance that a team member accidentally deletes a record increases. Make sure your CRM can undelete a record or revert it to a previous version from yesterday or last week. Mistakes do happen.

The Database Ditch Secret: Never let your database be held hostage. Some CRMs intentionally limit their export features to trap you with their product. Perform a full data export at least once a year. This ensures you can walk away from any vendor or brokerage with your business fully intact. 

The Big Bounce Secret: A change in someone’s contact information could be the first signal of a major life change. You can detect this when you get a bounced email or a returned postal letter. Use this information as a signal to make a personal call and reconnect with a client when they may need you most.

The “Top100” Tango Secret: Your most important contacts are clients/friends who refer you, key influencers, and vendor partners who send you business. Add a category “Top100” to those people. You should also stay in regular contact with everyone on your “Top100” list by calling them regularly using a repeating touch cycle.

Christmas Card Test Secret: When preparing your mailing list each year, apply the Christmas card test. The test is simple: ask yourself, “Do I genuinely want to send this person a card?” If the answer is “no” then this person is cluttering your database, and you should add the category “Cold,” indicating they are marked for eventual deletion. You keep your database healthy by ensuring it’s full of authentic relationships, not strangers.

Separate the Strangers Secret: Put strangers into a prospects database and people you know into your contacts database. That way, you can more easily clean out your old, dead leads each year.

The Person Power Secret: Automation is for following up, not for first contact. A robot cannot build rapport through email, let alone over the phone. During your first call, do what automation can’t: build a human connection. Only after that should you use automated emails to deliver relevant and valuable information to your contact.

The Capitalist Connection Secret: Use your CRM as the central hub for your business tools. Integrate specialized third-party products for websites, paid lead services, postcards, and marketing, choosing whichever vendor offers the best option. This approach lets you choose the best tools and prevents you from being locked into a single vendor.           

The Depression Diviner Secret: Your CRM’s year-over-year reports reveal shifts in the market before they become obvious. For example, your data might show fewer buyers are converting or more deals are collapsing due to financing issues. Treat these as warning signs and shift your focus toward investors or rentals. You’ll be able to stay ahead while other agents figure out why their buyers have disappeared.

The Call-to-Closing Ratio Secret: Leverage your CRM’s historical data to discover your actual conversion rate from conversations to closings. Knowing this figure helps you determine how many prospecting calls to make each day to reach your financial goals.

The Sister City Secret: Hire a real estate coach from a similar market but in a different city. Picking an agent in a different city means they will not be your direct competitor. That way they have no reason to hold back their most profitable lead-generation systems, marketing materials, or scripts. Then you can learn from their unedited playbook for building a top-producing business.

The Role Control Secret: For an assistant email address use a role-based email address with a general term like “info” instead of a specific person’s name. For example, your assistant’s email could be info@SallySellsSarasota.com. This way, the email address stays the same if you change or hire a new assistant.

The Balanced Buddy Secret: When hiring an assistant or choosing a partner, look for someone whose personality complements yours rather than mirrors it. Pairing different strengths-like a people-focused rainmaker with a detail-oriented organizer-creates a balanced, more effective team.

The Happy Handoff Secret: A real estate career can provide income after you stop working if you follow a succession plan. Succession plans involve bringing on a junior agent and spending 1-2 years transitioning your clients and database to them. You kick-start a younger agent’s career while your CRM database is the asset that generates referral income for you.

The Interested Investor Secret: When pitching a seller who needs a quick sale, mention that you sometimes work with cash buyers who are ready to close fast. Use your contacts database to stay in touch with deep-pocketed investors who are interested in special situations.

The Outstanding Offer Secret: Investors are looking strictly at the numbers, and do not fall in love with a property. A savvy investor might use multiple consecutive lowball offers with tight deadlines as a negotiating tactic. They keep one offer active at a time, then once it’s rejected, they quickly make an offer on another property. The first seller to accept is the winner. Use your CRM to track each offer and its deadline, ensuring you do not have more than one offer active at a time.

The Rental Reconnaissance Secret: Managing rentals for someone else helps you learn how to handle rental management for when you eventually become a landlord yourself. Many real estate agents own rental properties and consider them an excellent investment for retirement.

The Remote Reassurance Secret: Owners of vacation homes may be unaware of the daily real estate activity near their homes, as they typically visit only a few days each year. Periodic postcards, like "just listed / just sold," and an annual summary of properties sold in the neighborhood are especially effective tools for fostering engagement among vacation homeowners. These postcards are valuable items that your prospects will likely keep. I recommend sending these cards to the owner’s home address rather than the second home's address.

The Veteran’s Valet Secret: Many listing agents distrust VA loans due to the strict appraisal requirements and associated delays. For this reason, VA loan offers are considered less competitive than other offers. You can deal with this concern by pre-inspecting the property against the VA Minimum Property Requirements before making an offer. After the property is inspected, you’ll need to show that your client’s financing won’t cause delays. Have your VA lender call the listing agent to confirm the buyer is fully underwritten and the loan is ready to close.

Realtor Roots Secret: A great parting gift is to give your prospects your business card taped to a packet of seeds. This is a subtle reminder that owning a home means that you can enjoy planting flowers, having a vegetable garden, or just sitting under a shade tree with a cool beverage.

Baby on Board Secret: When someone shares that they are having a new baby, that’s a sign that they might need your assistance soon. One of the most common reasons why someone might want to upsize their home is that they have a growing family and need more space.

Bride’s Buddy Secret: Marriage often triggers a couple’s first serious consideration of homeownership. By attending bridal shows and offering educational seminars like a “Home Buying for Couples,” you can connect with engaged couples early, provide practical advice, and capture their contact information for follow-up. Positioning yourself as a knowledgeable, trustworthy resource to turn newlyweds into first-time homebuyers and long-term clients.

The Showing Scorecard Secret: After enough showings, your buyer will start to blur the houses they see together. Use your CRM’s showings feature to log their thoughts on each property they tour. If they forget which house had the nice fence or stonework, you can remind them, even if weeks have gone by.

Firm Friend Secret: Build relationships with large local companies that have employee relocation programs. Offer specialized services to help transferring employees buy or sell homes, minimizing disruption and showcasing your value. This is a source of repeat business.

Attorney’s Ally Secret: Befriend divorce attorneys and offer neutral property valuations for their cases. You will become their trusted partner, building a pipeline of non-negotiable sales.

Probate Patience Secret: Prospect probate leads with patience and sensitivity. The agent who acts as a trusted advisor, not a pushy salesperson, ultimately wins the listing.

Pen Pal Probate Secret: Prioritize probate leads where the executor lives out of town. Sellers are more likely to be motivated to move the property quickly.

The Speed-to-Lead Secret: Respond to all internet needs as quickly as possible, preferably within 5 minutes. Each lead you get is probably also reaching out to other agents as well. Take advantage of the features in your CRM to minimize your response times such as email feed, call capture, click-to-dial, and smart phone synchronization.

Freedom First Secret: If you choose a CRM that also includes a website, it becomes harder to leave if you're unhappy, since you'd have to leave both. To maintain freedom of choice, use two vendors— one for your CRM and one for your website.

Signs of Success Secret: Ask your clients on closing day if you can take and share a celebratory photo of them holding their new keys or standing with your Sold sign. A happy client is the strongest proof that you are an effective agent. Posting these photos on your social media feed is far more convincing to future clients than a stack of written testimonials.

Reliable Realtor Secret: Do not rely on social media to generate new leads. Industry data shows that only about 2 percent of business comes directly from these platforms. The real purpose of social media is validation. It serves as a professional background check for referrals and prospects, demonstrating that you are active, credible, and trusted before you ever speak with them.

The Reputation Ripple Secret: Write a detailed positive review for a local business you admire once a week. The local businesses you review can range from a favorite coffee shop to your go-to home inspector. If you know the owner, let them know you left a review. This will start a network of reciprocal relationships in your local area.

The Single Step Secret: After each interaction with a prospect, schedule only the next follow-up. Avoid the urge to create a complicated follow-up plan. A simple touch cycle is almost always the right approach; it lets you adapt based on your prospect's feedback.

Streak Reward Secret: Set a modest personal reward you will only unlock after five consecutive workdays of hitting your call and conversation targets. Protect the streak. The habit is the asset.

Lead With the Lender Secret: Before touring houses with a new buyer, have them meet with your trusted lender. Your lender can help them get pre-qualified for a loan, which shows what they can afford. Getting a pre-qualification early will prevent your new buyers from looking at houses they cannot afford. This also saves you from chasing a deal that cannot close.

The Bridge Builder Secret: Don’t focus on one-off referrals; instead, develop relationships with people who can connect you to many clients over time. Relationships with divorce attorneys, mortgage brokers, and HR managers are more valuable than a few random leads. Connecting and staying in touch with each of these individuals will generate a steady flow of quality clients.

The Adoption Angle Secret: When you sell a home, add the buyer to your CRM. Their agent will probably forget them, allowing you to adopt a new client for their next move.

The Warranty Wall Secret: Older homes often struggle to compete with new construction. To level the playing field, consider having your seller offer a home warranty. A home warranty is a contract that covers repairs or replacements of major systems and appliances. These costly repairs can be a major concern for buyers when buying an older home. Providing a warranty against these unexpected expenses makes older homes more competitive with new constructions.

Text After Voice Secret: When you call a lead and they don’t answer, do not leave a voicemail. Instead, send them a text message along the lines of “Hi Sally, this is Josh Wheeler, from RE/MAX. I just tried calling you to give you an update about the house on Main Street. When is a good time for a quick chat?”

Lucky Ladder Secret: Your aim in every prospect interaction is to communicate as interactively as possible. Think of communication methods as rungs on a ladder. At the bottom are email exchanges; a little higher are text messages; even higher are phone conversations. You should always work to climb the ladder by moving away from one-sided communication. Your ultimate goal? Meeting face to face.

Unread Alert Secret: Your CRM tracks when an email is sent but not read. If several of the emails you send to someone aren't being read, that means they're ending up in spam or the recipient is no longer using that email address. Usually, four emails in a row are considered a red flag. Your CRM may identify these low-engagement records by adding a category called “Unread.” If that happens, stop sending additional emails, as it could damage your email reputation. Instead, contact this person through another method, like a phone call.

Postscript Powerplay Secret: Eye-tracking studies show that the postscript, or “P.S.,” is one of the most-read parts of any email, often getting more attention than the body of the message itself. This means it is last thing your reader will see and the first thing they will act on.

Seasonal Send Secret: Send your newsletter only twice a year during peak season. This makes your market updates feel like an anticipated event, not just more inbox clutter.

The eCard Engagement Secret: Sending a friendly holiday eCard helps you maintain a healthy database. Active contacts will open your email, while inactive ones won't, and invalid email addresses can also be identified. Use these results to see who's still engaged and remove invalid or inactive contacts from your list.

The Postal Prowess Secret: Use your annual Christmas card mailing to update your address book. Print “Address Service Requested” on the envelopes. If a past client has moved, the post office will forward you the card and send you their new address. This helps you discover when a client has moved.

The Birthday Bank Secret: A birthday call is a great reason to reconnect with past clients. Eventually, when the time is right, they’ll contact you for business because you stayed on their mind. You are their friend who also happens to be a real estate agent.

Stork Sign Secret: After the baby is born, offer to put up a celebratory stork sign in your friend’s front yard. This thoughtful, public gesture is a great way to celebrate a milestone and demonstrate to the neighborhood that you are a caring, community-minded agent.

The Property Picture Secret: Before delivering your pre-listing package, drive by the seller‚Äôs home and take a photo of it. Print the photo on the label for the front of the package. This demonstrates you‚Äôve done your homework, and their house isn‚Äôt just another generic appointment.                                                                         

The Proper Price Secret: A CMA is useful, but nothing establishes a realistic price better than seeing the competition firsthand. After showing your seller the data, take them on a tour of the top three competing homes on the market. This gives them a buyer's-eye view and makes your pricing recommendation seem more aligned with market reality.

QR Code Secret: A great way to strengthen your pre-listing package is to add a QR code that links to a landing page for sellers. This page can provide a brief video introduction, client testimonials, and a gallery of your past work. It’s a modern way to make a strong impression and give sellers a preview of your expertise before you even meet.

Solar Sign Secret: To increase your yard sign's visibility after dark, use a solar-powered or timer-controlled light. This detail is important because serious buyers often drive through neighborhoods after work hours to evaluate the home's nighttime appearance and curb appeal.

Flyer Funnel Secret: Don't include the price on your flyers. Instead, tell them they can get the current price by texting a three-digit code to your call capture phone number. This way, you avoid updating your flyers when the price changes, and you also collect contact information in your CRM from anyone who calls.

Perfect Price Secret: Use your service report to inform your seller if their house is overpriced. Keep the conversation focused on objective market feedback rather than making it personal. When a price adjustment becomes clearly necessary, let the data in the service report speak for itself.

The Digital Defense Secret: Protect yourself from legal liability after closing by documenting important details in your CRM. Your best protection is to maintain permanent, time-stamped logs. The easiest way to record every disclosure, client conversation, conveyance, and contingency is to log them in your CRM.

The Basket Bridge Secret: When giving a gift to new homeowners, consider offering them a basket of items bought at a local farmer’s market, such as bread, honey, cheese, wine, or crafts. You could even use this as a chance to talk with local business owners and let them know you are introducing their products to a new resident, strengthening your relationship with them.
