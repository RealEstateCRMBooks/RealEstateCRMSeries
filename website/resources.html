                        <p>For real estate agents there is a delay between work and payment. New agents will typically
                            see their first commission check arrive 3-6 months after starting. Because of this time lag
                            new agents should keep their expenses lean until closing a few deals.</p>

                        <p>Export your entire database at least once a year. Accidents happen, and a backup is a good
                            safety step. Also, someday you may change brokerages and will undoubtedly want to take your
                            database with you. Keeping a backup of your database gives you peace of mind.</p>

                        <p>Ask a more experienced agent in your office if they have any buyer clients they could send
                            your way. You would pay the other agent a referral fee, so both of you make money when the
                            deal closes. That way, the more experienced agent can focus on more profitable clients, like
                            listings.</p>

                        <p>To jump-start your first sales, offer a friends and family commission discount to your
                            relatives and close friends. You can also extend this insider treatment as a special deal to
                            your first client in a new geographic farm. This approach generates immediate goodwill and
                            makes new clients feel like they are being treated just like family.</p>

                        <p>Look for opportunities where your success directly benefits your mentor. This can be
                            assisting them with open houses, following up with leads they can’t get to, or taking
                            overflow clients. When your growth adds to their production, you create a partnership where
                            both of you are invested in each other’s success.</p>

                        <p>Always be able to answer the question: “How is the market?” When you answer, it should be
                            with an in-depth explanation that includes local inventory levels, average days on the
                            market, and recent sales. Taking a step beyond “yes,” “no,” or “it’s complicated” is
                            important in selling yourself by showing that you are an authority on the market.</p>

                            you identify which lead sources generate the most volume of leads. However, the number of
                            leads is not as important as their profitability. At the end of each quarter, analyze your
                            lead sources to see which ones generated closings. That way, you can focus on the most
                            profitable lead sources.</p>

                        <p>When you show your buyer a listing, take the time to understand what they are looking for,
                            not only in features, but from the community. Take time to ask about resources such as
                            churches, schools, hospitals, shops, and even consider ages of the children and their needs.
                            By taking a wholistic approach to the home purchase process, you are connecting your buyer
                            with the neighborhood in ways that build enthusiasm for not just the home, but the
                            community.</p>

                        <p>Emails often feel automated and cold. To stand out you can add a handwritten signature. This
                            small detail makes your communication feel more personal and professional. Sign your name on
                            white paper and take a picture. Upload that picture to your CRM’s signature editor, and now
                            you can include it to all your email and print communications.</p>

                        <h3>The <span class="secret-name">Lead with the Letterhead</span> Secret</h3>
                        <p>Many CRM’s offer a letterhead feature which allows you place your company logo and portrait
                            photo at the top of your correspondence. That way, this information is immediately visible
                            when someone starts reading your email. Putting your branding at the bottom in your
                            signature is not ideal. Most people decide if they want to delete or read an email within
                            just a second or two and won’t bother scrolling down to see your email signature. So, to
                            maximize the chances someone will read your email, make sure your branding is at the top of
                            all your emails by using the letterhead feature of your CRM.</p>

                            conversations. This transforms a generic card into a memorable, customized reminder of your
                            interaction. (Make sure your selected card stock will take pen and pencil, so no shiny

                            real estate. This positions you as a community ambassador who is willing to build

                            as politics or religion.</p>

                            property flyers. Include a photo of an adoptable animal and a short bio from the shelter.
                            This simple act changes your marketing material into a community service piece. Instead of
                            just another agent with just another listing, you become a friend of dogs everywhere.</p>

                        <p>CRM vendors sometimes advertise features that sound amazing. But sometimes things sound
                            better than they are. The only way to trust a CRM feature is to use the free trial and
                            personally test that feature. If you get stuck, call technical support. That’s when you’ll
                            find out if those features were too good to be true and how good the technical support
                            really is. The last thing you want to do is purchase a CRM and then later realize that the
                            product is buggy, works imperfectly, or the salesperson exaggerated its capabilities.</p>

                            don’t have to scroll to the end of the notes to see the latest note. Your CRM may have a
                            preference setting which makes this automatic.</p>

                            Your CRM may identify these low-engagement records by adding a category called “Unread.” If
                            that happens, stop sending additional emails, as it could damage your email reputation.

                        <p>When giving a gift to new homeowners, consider offering them a basket of items bought at a
                            local farmer’s market, such as bread, honey, cheese, wine, or crafts. You could even use
                            this as a chance to talk with local business owners and let them know you are introducing
                            their products to a new resident, strengthening your relationship with them.</p>
